## README

# What?
This plugin will search URLs in the currently opened document and open it in different tabs in Firefox.
Yes, you need to have firefox installed.


# Why?
Any case where you need to open more than two links in the browser, it's more work! 

# How?
Open any document in VSCode (Maybe copy the blog you found on internet with links), hit the command "open links" in your document.

# Requirements
- You need to have firefox installed

(Other browsers are yet to support the multi tab option, I need add support for those too)
